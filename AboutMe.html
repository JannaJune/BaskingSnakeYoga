	<p>
	Boozhoo, Husawayaatamook nindizhinikaaz. Ma'iingan nindoodem. Winnipeg, Manitoba nindoonjibaa. Wabaseemoong, Ontario nindaa. Hello, my name is Donna Diaz-Lopez.  I come from the Wolf clan. I was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba and currently reside in Wabaseemoong (Whitedog), Ontario.</p>
	<p>I started out with skeptical thoughts about yoga like many people. I heard good things but never experienced it for myself. In 2014, I was suffering with depression and anxiety, and my physical health was not well. At one point I made a trip to the emergency room for what I thought was pneumonia, but it turned out to be much more. In the following months, I had a lung test, x-rays and finally a biopsy. By New Years Eve, doctors removed two ping pong ball sized granulomas. I was diagnosed with Sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease, of which had affected my lungs. The doctor informed me that I needed to start doing something to improve my health. Throughout my recovery, I found a 30-day yoga challenge online. Little did I know how much this would change my life. Fast forward to a few years later... I have since acquired my 200hr YTT, offered free classes in my community of Wabaseemoong, and launched my own website. My goal is to help those who have found themselves stuck, feel like they don't know where to start, or simply want to explore yoga. I love meeting people, hearing their stories, sharing and learning our Indigenous cultures, and meeting people where they are at. You don't need to be flexible, touch your toes, or know the poses, you simply need to show up on the mat, and let things flow.
Get comfortable in your own skin.</p>
